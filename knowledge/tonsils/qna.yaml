      ## Structure
      Humans are born with four types of tonsils: the pharyngeal tonsil, two
      tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the lingual tonsils.[1]

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the location of the tubal tonsils?
        answer: The location of the tubal tonsils is the roof of the pharynx.


      - question: Compare the epithelial types, encapsulation, and presence of crypts in the pharyngeal, tubal, and palatine tonsils according to the table provided.
        answer: The pharyngeal tonsil features ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium and is incompletely encapsulated with small folds sometimes described as crypts. The tubal tonsils also have ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium but are not encapsulated and do not possess crypts. In contrast, the palatine tonsils are covered with stratified squamous epithelium, are fully encapsulated, and contain multiple deep crypts. These structural differences are indicative of their varied anatomical locations and potentially their distinct functions within the immune system.



  - context: |
      The **tonsils** are a set of [lymphoid](Lymphatic_system "wikilink")
      organs facing into the aerodigestive tract, which is known as
      [Waldeyer's tonsillar ring](Waldeyer's_tonsillar_ring "wikilink") and
      consists of the [adenoid tonsil](adenoid "wikilink") (or pharyngeal
      tonsil), two [tubal tonsils](tubal_tonsil "wikilink"), two [palatine
      tonsils](palatine_tonsil "wikilink"), and the [lingual
      tonsils](lingual_tonsil "wikilink"). These organs play an important role
      in the immune system.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the immune system's first line of defense?
        answer: The tonsils are the immune system's first line of defense against ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens.
