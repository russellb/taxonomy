# Tonsils

The **tonsils** are a set of lymphoid organs facing into the aerodigestive
tract, which is known as Waldeyer's tonsillar ring and consists of the adenoid
tonsil or pharyngeal tonsil, two tubal tonsils, two palatine tonsils, and the
lingual tonsils. These organs play an important role in the immune system. When
used unqualified, the term most commonly refers specifically to the palatine
tonsils, which are two lymphoid organs situated at either side of the back of
the human throat. The palatine tonsils and the adenoid tonsil are organs
consisting of lymphoepithelial tissue located near the oropharynx and
nasopharynx parts of the throat.
